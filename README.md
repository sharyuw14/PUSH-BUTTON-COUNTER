# PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER
This project uses a push button with Arduino Uno to build a simple counter. Each button press increases the count, which is displayed on a 16x2 LCD or Serial Monitor. It includes circuit design, coding, and demonstration, and helps understand digital input and real-time data display.
